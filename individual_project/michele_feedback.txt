The design of your app is silly and fun, so good job with that. However, there is a slightly annoying bug that makes your app hard to use. The error I get when I open your app is “ Bad arguments to GetMillis. The operation GetMillis cannot accept the arguments: false “. What this implies to me is that you are trying to set the argument of GetMillis somewhere with a variable that you do not initialize to false. Without looking at your blocks editor, my best guess for what is happening is that your timer is automatically turned on when you start the app. You also have a method to turn on the timer when you press “set alarm”, which is great. But the other thing to do that will (I think) solve your problem is set the alarm to “OFF” when the screen first initializes. 

The design looks clean and easy to use, so good job with that. It is unfortunate that this simple bug basically makes the app unusable. It is a very easy to fix, if you want to take a small amount of time to fix it and get the app working just like you want. If you send me a screenshot of your blocks editor I can even more specifically tell you what the problem is. All in all, great job with the design and implementation - you took a hard project and did a great job with it.
